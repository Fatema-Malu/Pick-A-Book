# Pick-A-Book
The main objective of an online bookstore system is to create an online book store that allows users to search and purchase a book online based on its title, book Id or author name. The selected books are added to the cart from where they can be displayed in a tabular format with the help of queries. The customers can search for a book by its category, add it to the shopping cart and finally make a purchase. Each customer has his own cart id from where we can fetch data to generate the bill. The system administrator will have additional functionalities when compared to the common user. He can add and update the book details, cart contents, customer information and also the available books. The Administrator will have additional functionalities when compared to the common user in order to make the application more user friendly. The main purpose of this system is to allow the system administrator to store details of a large number of books, allow for add, search, etc and to separate the functionalities of the system administrator and the user. Thus, the system should be able to satisfy the user requirement .It should be easy to understand and use and hence have a good user interface.
